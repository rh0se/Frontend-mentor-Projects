## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned
learned how to use the flex property of flexbox and i also learn how to use flexbox to create responsive designs.


```css
@media (max-width: 700px) {
    .first, .second{
        flex: 100%;
        
    }
}
```

### Continued development
Continue to use flexbox to make more responsive designs
