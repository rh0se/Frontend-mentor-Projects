### What I learned

I learnt how to use CSS Grid and I learned how to use CSS @font-face Rule.

see code snippets below:


```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Poppins-SemiBold';
    src: url('Poppins/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf')
}
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Poppins-ExtraLight';
    src: url('Poppins/Poppins-ExtraLight.ttf')
}

@font-face {
    font-family: 'Poppins';
    src: url('Poppins/Poppins-Regular.ttf')
}
```



### Continued development

I will continue to focus on learning and applying CSS Grid and I want to get more comfortable with making responsive web designs



### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15930003/downloading-a-google-font-and-setting-up-an-offline-site-that-uses-it) - This helped me in setting up a downloaded google font offline. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN WEB DOCS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand CSS GRID. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
