## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Font family](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) - For styles

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learnt how to use CSS Grid and I learned how to use CSS @font-face Rule.

see code snippets below:


```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Poppins-SemiBold';
    src: url('Poppins/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf')
}
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Poppins-ExtraLight';
    src: url('Poppins/Poppins-ExtraLight.ttf')
}

@font-face {
    font-family: 'Poppins';
    src: url('Poppins/Poppins-Regular.ttf')
}
```



### Continued development

I will continue to focus on learning and applying CSS Grid and I want to get more comfortable with making responsive web designs



### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15930003/downloading-a-google-font-and-setting-up-an-offline-site-that-uses-it) - This helped me in setting up a downloaded google font offline. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN WEB DOCS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand CSS GRID. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
