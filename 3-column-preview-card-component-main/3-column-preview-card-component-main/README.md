## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


- Family: [Lexend Deca](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Deca)
- Weights: 400

- Family: [Big Shoulders Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Big+Shoulders+Display)
- Weights: 700



### What I learned
I became more comfortable with using flexbox to create responsive designs and I learned how to use SCSS


```scss
$Bright-orange: hsl(31, 77%, 52%);
$Dark-cyan: hsl(184, 100%, 22%);
$Very-dark-cyan: hsl(179, 100%, 13%);
$Transparent-white: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);
$Very-light-gray: hsl(0, 0%, 95%);

@mixin bottom-radius {
    border-radius: 0 0 10px 10px;
} 

```


### Continued development
I will continue development in using various css properties like Css Grid and media Queries in creating responsive design.
