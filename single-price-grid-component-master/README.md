## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

learnt how to use css grid and became more comfortable with SCSS


```css
.container {
    min-height: 444px;
    width: min(85%, 650px);
    display: grid;
    grid-auto-flow: row;
    grid-row: auto;

    @media (min-width: 600px){
        grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
        grid-auto-rows: 200px auto;
    }
  
}
```


### Continued development

i will continue development of responsive websites with css grid.
