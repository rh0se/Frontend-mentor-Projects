### What I learned

I learned how to create an transparent overlay on an image when the user hovers on the image.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.overlay:hover{
    
    background-color: rgba(0, 255, 247, 0.5);
    
}

```


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay_title.asp) - This helped me for the overlay effect. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
